- What is this?

Currently, this is just a MATLAB class together with some auxiliary functions that can be used to represent and manipulate polynomials in MATLAB.

- What is this supposed to become?

In time, the hope is that this will become a parser for moment problems (and possibly their duals) to be used in combination with yalmip (http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/).

- How do I install this?

Just copy the files into some folder on your MATLAB path.

- How do I use this?  

First declare your variables by typing

pol x 2;
pol y 3;

This creates in your workspace a 2-dimensional vector of variables [x(1);x(2)] and a 3-dimensional vector of variables [y(1);y(2);y(3)]. You can then construct polynomials in these variables by combining them using elementary operations. For example,

p = 2*x(1)^2*y(2)-5*y(1)^3;

stores the polynomial 2x(1)^2y(2)-5y(1)^3 into p.

You can also differentiate polynomials, for example 

diff(p,x(1)) 

returns

4x(1)y(2).
